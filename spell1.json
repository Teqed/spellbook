The panacea has no side effects (for example, the intoxication panacea does not cause a hangover). When you use polypurpose panacea, choose one of the following effects.  Analgesic: You do not feel minor aches and pains, such as from arthritis, a cold, or a hangover, for 1 hour. For the duration, you gain a +2 resistance bonus against pain-related spells.  Clarity: You get a +1 competence bonus on a single attack roll, saving throw, or skill check within 1 minute. You must choose to use the bonus before making the roll to which it applies.  Hallucination: You have pleasant hallucinations for 1 hour, such as wandering lights, music, playful surreal animals, and so on. You can tell these are not real, but they are distracting, and you take a -2 penalty on Perception checks for the duration.  Intoxication: You feel comfortably intoxicated for 1 hour, as if you had a few alcoholic beverages.  Lucid Dream: If you take this panacea within 1 hour of going to sleep, you have a lucid dream that is under your control and lasts for an hour.  Resistance: You gain a +1 resistance bonus on saves for 1 minute.  Sleep: You enter a pleasant and restful sleep for at least 1 hour unless wakened. If you would normally begin sleeping at this time, when the panacea ends you continue sleeping normally.  Sobriety: You become completely sober for 1 hour, negating any penalties to your actions for being drunk (GameMastery Guide 237). Magical and alchemical methods (such as detect poison) still detect you as inebriated.

On a successful saving throw, it successfully disbelieves and the spell's effect ends for that creature.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "1", "wiz": "1", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": "1", "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": "1", "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "1", "domain": "", "short_description": "You appear to be standing still, even when you take some actions.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": "Illusion of Calm", "id": 1340, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "1", "medium": null, "mesmerist": "1", "occultist": "1", "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Jury-Rig", "school": "transmutation", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "bard 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner/unchained summoner 1, witch 1, occultist 1, psychic 1", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M (a pinch of tree resin)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "touch", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one broken object of up to 2 lbs./level", "duration": "1 round/level", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates (harmless, object)", "spell_resistance": "yes (harmless, object)", "description": "When you cast this spell, a spectral force binds a broken weapon together, relieving the broken condition for a short time.

If you take electricity damage multiple times while this spell is active, use the largest amount of electricity damage you took to determine your touch attack damage.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "1", "wiz": "1", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": "1", "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "1", "domain": "", "short_description": "Store electricity attacks used against you and release the energy as a touch attack.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 1, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 1892, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Discern Next Of Kin", "school": "divination", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "mind-affecting", "spell_level": "bard 1, shaman 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1, occultist 1, psychic 1, mesmerist 1, spiritualist 1, medium 1", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, F (a copper piece)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "60 ft.", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one creature", "duration": "concentration, up to 1 minute/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates (see text)", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "You can scan the thoughts of one individual and learn the names and locations of the target's living relatives, as well as the attitude of the target toward those relatives (and vice versa).

You cannot cast this spell on another spellbook if you currently have a spellbook in the Ethereal Plane. No other creatures or objects accompany the spellbook you send away, and the duration of any spells currently affecting the spellbook continue normally.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "1", "wiz": "1", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": "1", "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "1", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2548, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Itching Curse", "school": "necromancy", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "curseUM", "spell_level": "antipaladin 1, bard 1, druid 1, inquisitor 1, occultist 1, shaman 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one living creature with 5 HD or fewer", "duration": "1 hour/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "You curse the target with a distracting, unbearable itch.

Coins increase in value as normal for the new type of coinage. For items other than coins, some of the value of the item comes from its craftsmanship, regardless of the metal used, so the value of the item seems to be 5 times (for silver items) or 50 times (for copper items) its true value. Thus, a copper candlestick originally worth 5 cp transformed by this spell appears to be worth 250 cp, or 2 gp and 5 sp. A successful DC 25 Appraise check automatically detects the true nature of the coins or items. Creatures inspecting or interacting with the coins or items can attempt a saving throw to disbelieve the illusion.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "1", "wiz": "1", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": "1", "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "1", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2774, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "1", "medium": "1", "mesmerist": "1", "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Hobble", "school": "transmutation", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "bard 1, bloodrager 1, inquisitor 1, magus 1, mesmerist 1, ranger 1, sorcerer/wizard 1", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M (a drop of glue)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 20 feet apart", "duration": "1 round/level", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Fortitude negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "This spell disrupts the method a target uses for movement.
