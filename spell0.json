If the items or creatures bearing the auras are in line of sight, you can make Knowledge (arcana) skill checks to determine the school of magic involved in each. (Make one check per aura: DC 15 + spell level, or 15 + 1/2 caster level for a nonspell effect.) If the aura emanates from a magic item, you can attempt to identify its properties (see Spellcraft).</p><p>Magical areas, multiple types of magic, or strong local magical emanations may distort or conceal weaker auras.</p><p><i>Aura Strength</i>: An aura's power depends on a spell's functioning spell level or an item's caster level; see the accompanying table. If an aura falls into more than one category, detect magic indicates the stronger of the two.</p><p><table border = '1'><tr><th rowspan=\"2\">Spell or Object</th><th colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\">Aura Power</th></tr> <tr><th>Faint</th><th>Moderate</th><th>Strong</th><th>Overwhelming</th></tr> <tr><td>Functioning spell (spell level)</td><td>3rd or lower</td><td>4th-6th</td><td>7th-9th</td><td>10th+ (deity-level)</td></tr> <tr><td>Magic item (caster level)</td><td>5th or lower</td><td>6th-11th</td><td>12th-20th</td><td>21st+ (artifact)</td></tr></table>  <i>Lingering Aura</i>: A magical aura lingers after its original source dissipates (in the case of a spell) or is destroyed (in the case of a magic item). If <i>detect magic</i> is cast and directed at such a location, the spell indicates an aura strength of dim (even weaker than a faint aura). How long the aura lingers at this dim level depends on its original power: <table border = '1'><tr><th>Original Strength</th><th>Duration of Lingering Aura</th></tr> <tr><td>Faint</td><td>1d6 rounds</td></tr> <tr><td>Moderate</td><td>1d6 minutes</td></tr> <tr><td>Strong</td><td>1d6x10 minutes</td></tr> <tr><td>Overwhelming</td><td>1d6 days</td></tr></table>  Outsiders and elementals are not magical in themselves, but if they are summoned, the conjuration spell registers.
