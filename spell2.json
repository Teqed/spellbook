You can't send or receive an object into a space that is protected by an <i>antimagic field</i>, <i>globe of invulnerability</i>, or similar effect that keeps magical effects out; if you attempt to do so, the spell is lost.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 0, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "2", "wiz": "2", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": "2", "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": "2", "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "2", "domain": "", "short_description": "Send or receive a small object via teleportation.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2101, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "2", "medium": "2", "mesmerist": "2", "occultist": "2", "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Garden Of Peril", "school": "conjuration", "subschool": "creation", "descriptor": "poisonUM", "spell_level": "druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner/unchained summoner 2, witch 2", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M/DF (a pinch of spores)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)", "area": "", "effect": "one poisonous mushroom/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart", "targets": "", "duration": "1 round/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Fortitude negates", "spell_resistance": "no", "description": "Vividly colored poisonous mushrooms instantly spring into existence in squares you select.

When a <i>ghost whip</i> attack passes through total cover, the target is treated as having total concealment (50% miss chance). Against incorporeal and undead creatures,  a <i>ghost whip</i> deals lethal damage and can be used to perform drag or reposition combat maneuvers (in addition to a whip's normal disarm and trip maneuvers). A <i>ghost whip</i> cannot be disarmed or sundered.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "2", "wiz": "2", "cleric": "2", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": "2", "inquisitor": "2", "oracle": "2", "antipaladin": null, "magus": "2", "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "2", "domain": "", "short_description": "Create a ghost touch whip that passes through objects.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2186, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "Ectoplasm (5)", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "2", "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": "2", "spiritualist": "2", "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Paranoia", "school": "illusion", "subschool": "phantasm", "descriptor": "mind-affecting", "spell_level": "bard 2, medium 1, mesmerist 1, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S", "costly_components": 0, "range": "", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one creature", "duration": "1 round/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "The target believes everyone it sees is an enemy.

Armor and natural armor have no effect on the damage dealt by a rock whip (unlike a normal whip), but the whip deals no damage to outsiders with the earth subtype. Attacks with a rock whip strike with resounding  force; you can make a free bull rush combat maneuver against any creature you strike with a rock whip, using your caster level in place of your base attack bonus and your primary casting ability score modifier (Charisma for sorcerers, Intelligence for wizards, and so on) in place of your Strength modifier.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "2", "wiz": "2", "cleric": "2", "druid": "2", "ranger": "1", "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": "2", "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "2", "antipaladin": null, "magus": "2", "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "2", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 4828, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": "2", "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": "1", "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Radiation Ward", "school": "abjuration", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "alchemist 2, cleric/oracle 2, druid 2, ranger 1, shaman 2, sorcerer/wizard 2", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S", "costly_components": 0, "range": "touch", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "creature touched", "duration": "1 hour/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Fort negates (harmless)", "spell_resistance": "yes (harmless)", "description": "A creature warded by this spell gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against radiation-based effects.

This imposes the shaken condition on the creature for 1 day per caster level; during this time, the creature takes a -2 penalty on saving throws against spells you cast with the fear descriptor.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "2", "wiz": "2", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": "2", "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": "2", "oracle": null, "antipaladin": "1", "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "2", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 1, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 1, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 4865, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "2", "medium": null, "mesmerist": "2", "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Obscured Script", "school": "illusion", "subschool": "phantasm", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "bard 2, mesmerist 2, occultist 2, psychic 2, sorcerer/wizard 2", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M (a scrap of paper bearing a simple sentence written in at least five languages)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "touch", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one touched page, scroll, inscription, book, or other document no more than 3 feet in any dimension", "duration": "24 hours (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "none; see text", "spell_resistance": "no", "description": "You create a latent illusion that clouds the judgment and reading ability of any creature that examines a targeted text.

When the rune is activated, the effects of the consumable magic item resolve at a caster level that is 2 higher than the item's actual caster level. Humility: When a creature activates the rune of humility, it does not provoke attacks of opportunity for 1 round. Kindness: A creature must be using the aid another action or casting a healing spell in order to activate a rune of kindness. If the creature activates the rune while using the aid another action, the bonus imparted on a success increases to +5. If the creature instead activates the rune while casting a healing spell, the effective caster level of the spell increases by 2. Love: When a creature activates the rune of love as he casts a spell with the charm descriptor, the save DC of that spell increases by 1. Alternatively, a creature can activate the rune of love after he rolls damage for a weapon or spell attack, causing the damage dealt to become nonlethal damage. Temperance: A creature bearing the rune of temperance can activate it as an immediate action immediately upon failing a saving throw against a poison, disease, drug, or similar effect. The creature can immediately attempt a second saving throw against the effect and can use the result of that second saving throw as the actual result. Zeal: A creature that activates the rune of zeal gains a +3 bonus on Will saves, and the save DCs of all language-dependent effects created by the creature increase by 1; these effects last for 1 round.", "description_formatted": "<p>Investigations into the ancient and mysterious traditions of the seven virtues of rule of the lost human empire of Azlant, which were later corrupted by the runelords into the more familiar seven deadly sins, inspired the Cyphermages to develop the runes of rule.
