Dispel magic can dispel (but not counter) spell-like effects just as it does spells. The of a spell with an instantaneous duration can't be dispelled, because the magical effect is already over before the dispel magic can take effect. You choose to use dispel magic in one of two ways: a targeted dispel or a counterspell. Targeted Dispel: One object, creature, or spell is the target of the dispel magic spell. You make one dispel check (1d20 + your caster level) and compare that to the spell with highest caster level (DC = 11 + the spell's caster level). If successful, that spell ends. If not, compare the same result to the spell with the next highest caster level. Repeat this process until you have dispelled one spell affecting the target, or you have failed to dispel every spell. For example, a 7th-level caster casts dispel magic, targeting a creature affected by stoneskin (caster level 12th) and fly (caster level 6th). The caster level check results in a 19. This check is not high enough to end the stoneskin (which would have required a 23 or higher), but it is high enough to end the fly (which only required a 17). Had the dispel check resulted in a 23 or higher, the stoneskin would have been dispelled, leaving the fly intact. Had the dispel check been a 16 or less, no spells would have been affected. You can also use a targeted dispel to specifically end one spell affecting the target or one spell affecting an area (such as a wall of fire). You must name the specific spell effect to be targeted in this way. If your caster level check is equal to or higher than the DC of that spell, it ends. No other spells or effects on the target are dispelled if your check is not high enough to end the targeted effect. If you target an object or creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell (such as a monster summoned by summon monster), you make a dispel check to end the spell that conjured the object or creature. If the object that you target is a magic item, you make a dispel check against the item's caster level (DC = 11 + the item's caster level). If you succeed, all the item's magical properties are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, after which the item recovers its magical properties. A suppressed item becomes nonmagical for the duration of the effect. An interdimensional opening (such as a bag of holding) is temporarily closed. A magic item's physical properties are unchanged: A suppressed magic sword is still a sword (a masterwork sword, in fact). Artifacts and deities are unaffected by mortal magic such as this. You automatically succeed on your dispel check against any spell that you cast yourself.

Creatures in the area, or who later enter the area, receive only one attempt to suppress effects that are controlling them.  If successful, such effects are suppressed as long as they remain in the area. Creatures that leave the area and come back are not protected. You must overcome a creature's spell resistance in order to keep it at bay (as in the third function of protection from evil), but the deflection and resistance bonuses and the protection from mental control apply regardless of enemies' spell resistance.  This spell has an alternative version that you may choose when casting it. A magic circle against evil can be focused inward rather than outward. When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the lesser planar binding, planar binding, and greater planar binding spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the magic circle. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal protection from evil spell for that creature only.  A magic circle leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.  A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a dimensional anchor spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the anchor effect lasts as long as the magic circle does. The creature cannot reach across the magic circle, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.  You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the magic circle more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.  This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.  A successful diagram allows you to cast a dimensional anchor spell on the magic circle during the round before casting any summoning spell. The anchor holds any called creatures in the magic circle for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a magic circle prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the lesser planar binding spell), the DC increases by 5.

When focused inward, the spell binds a nongood called creature (such as those called by the <i><i>lesser planar binding</i>, planar binding,</i> and <i>greater planar binding</i> spells) for a maximum of 24 hours per caster level, provided that you cast the spell that calls the creature within 1 round of casting the <i>magic circle</i>. The creature cannot cross the circle's boundaries. If a creature too large to fit into the spell's area is the subject of the spell, the spell acts as a normal <i>protection from evil</i> spell for that creature only.</p><p>A <i>magic circle</i> leaves much to be desired as a trap. If the circle of powdered silver laid down in the process of spellcasting is broken, the effect immediately ends. The trapped creature can do nothing that disturbs the circle, directly or indirectly, but other creatures can. If the called creature has spell resistance, it can test the trap once a day. If you fail to overcome its spell resistance, the creature breaks free, destroying the circle.</p><p>A creature capable of any form of dimensional travel (astral projection, blink, dimension door, etherealness, gate, plane shift, shadow walk, teleport, and similar abilities) can simply leave the circle through such means. You can prevent the creature's extradimensional escape by casting a <i>dimensional <i>anchor</i></i> spell on it, but you must cast the spell before the creature acts. If you are successful, the <i>anchor</i> effect lasts as long as the <i>magic circle</i> does. The creature cannot reach across the <i>magic circle</i>, but its ranged attacks (ranged weapons, spells, magical abilities, and the like) can. The creature can attack any target it can reach with its ranged attacks except for the circle itself.</p><p>You can add a special diagram (a two-dimensional bounded figure with no gaps along its circumference, augmented with various magical sigils) to make the <i>magic circle</i> more secure. Drawing the diagram by hand takes 10 minutes and requires a DC 20 Spellcraft check. You do not know the result of this check. If the check fails, the diagram is ineffective. You can take 10 when drawing the diagram if you are under no particular time pressure to complete the task.</p><p>This task also takes 10 full minutes. If time is no factor at all, and you devote 3 hours and 20 minutes to the task, you can take 20.</p><p>A successful diagram allows you to cast a <i>dimensional <i>anchor</i></i> spell on the <i>magic circle</i> during the round before casting any summoning spell. The <i>anchor</i> holds any called creatures in the <i>magic circle</i> for 24 hours per caster level. A creature cannot use its spell resistance against a <i>magic circle</i> prepared with a diagram, and none of its abilities or attacks can cross the diagram. If the creature tries a Charisma check to break free of the trap (see the <i>lesser planar binding</i> spell), the DC increases by 5. The creature is immediately released if anything disturbs the diagram-even a straw laid across it. The creature itself cannot disturb the diagram either directly or indirectly, as noted above.</p><p>This spell is not cumulative with <i>protection from evil</i> and vice versa.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 1, "sor": "3", "wiz": "3", "cleric": "3", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": "3", "alchemist": null, "summoner": "3", "witch": null, "inquisitor": "3", "oracle": "3", "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "3", "domain": "Good (3)", "short_description": "As protection spells, but 10-ft. radius and 10 min./level.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 1, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": "Magic Circle against Evil", "id": 330, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "Celestial (7)", "patron": "Boundaries (6)", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": "3", "psychic": null, "medium": "3", "mesmerist": null, "occultist": "3", "spiritualist": "3", "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": "3"}, {"name": "Magic Circle against Chaos", "school": "abjuration", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "lawful", "spell_level": "cleric/oracle 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner/unchained summoner 3, inquisitor 3, shaman 3, occultist 3, spiritualist 3, medium 3", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M/DF (a 3-ft.-diameter circle of powdered silver)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "touch", "area": "10-ft.-radius emanation from touched creature", "effect": "", "targets": "", "duration": "10 min./level", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates (harmless)", "spell_resistance": "no;

If you cast harrowing on another creature, you must remain adjacent to the target for the duration of the casting time. A harrowing must describe one set of events or course of action (for example, \"hunting down the pirate king,\" or \"traveling to Viperwall to search for a magic sword\") that the target of the spell intends to undertake at some point during the spell's duration. If you have access to a Harrow deck, draw nine cards when this spell is cast. If you do not have a Harrow deck, you can simulate the draws by rolling a d6 and a d10 for each of the nine cards, as detailed on page 293 of this book. Record the ability score and alignment associated with each card. Each of these cards grants a luck bonus or a penalty on a specific type of d20 check; the magnitude of the penalty or bonus depends upon how closely that particular card's alignment matches the target creature's alignment. If the card and target's alignments are identical, that card provides a +2 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. If the card and target's alignments are of the opposite alignment (see below), the card inflicts a -1 penalty on that associated check. If the card has any other alignment, it provides a +1 luck bonus on the associated suit's check. While penalties persist on all associated checks for as long as the harrowing persists, the bonuses are one-use bonuses that the harrowed character can \"spend\" at any time to modify that card's associated check. You can spend a bonus to modify an appropriate roll after the die is rolled, but cannot spend the bonus once you know the result of the roll. Since all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing are luck bonuses, they do not stack with each other. Penalties, on the other hand, do stack. Once you spend all of the bonuses granted by a harrowing, or once the spell's duration ends, the spell ends and the penalties are removed. A single creature can only be under the effects of one harrowing at a time. If it is subjected to a second harrowing while a previous harrowing is still in effect, the new harrowing automatically fails.

The residual psychic impressions left upon the coin by other handlers help mask this dweomer from detection, protecting <i>gilded whispers</i> against location by <i>detect magic</i>, <i>arcane sight</i>, and similar effects unless the latter spell's caster succeeds on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast <i>gilded whispers</i>.</p><p>The <i>scrying</i> sensor created by using a divination (<i>scrying</i>) spell to observe or listen to the coin's surroundings can be detected as normal.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "3", "wiz": "3", "cleric": "4", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "4", "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "3", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 1240, "material_costs": "100", "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Stolen Light", "school": "illusion", "subschool": "figment", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 3", "casting_time": "1 full round", "components": "V, S, F (a gem worth at least 500 gp)", "costly_components": 1, "range": "touch", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "transparent gem touched", "duration": "permanent or 1 minute/level (see text)", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates (object)", "spell_resistance": "yes (object)", "description": "Kreighton Shaine researched this spell from the fragmentary notes of a Vudrani ascetic recorded in a strange tome, and rumors credit him with no fewer than a dozen permanent stolen light gems hidden in compartments and drawers in his study.

An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if <i>detect magic</i> is cast on it while it remains under this spell's effects.  When you drink a potion affected by this spell, you do not gain the potion's normal effect. Instead, the first necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion that <i>deathwine</i> affects. For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks <i>deathwine</i> made from a <i>potion of <i>cure serious wounds</i></i> would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster, as <i>cure serious wounds</i> i s a 3 rd-level spell.  In addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) that drinks a potion affected by <i>deathwine</i> is healed of 1d8 points of damage. Any potion not imbibed before this spell's duration expires is destroyed at the end of the <i>deathwine</i>'s duration.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "3", "wiz": "3", "cleric": "2", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": "2", "summoner": null, "witch": "3", "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "2", "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "3", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 1576, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Swipe", "school": "conjuration", "subschool": "teleportation", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one held item", "duration": "instant", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "none", "spell_resistance": "no", "description": "By flicking a finger in the appropriate direction and proclaiming ownership, you attempt to magically wrest an item from the target's grip and summon it to your hand.

For example, if at nightfall a vampire commanded a dominated victim to walk to a cemetery, this spell can reveal the vampire's general location at that time, though it may have moved since then.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 1, "sor": "3", "wiz": "3", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": "3", "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": "3", "inquisitor": "3", "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "3", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 1, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 1593, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Steal Years", "school": "transmutation", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "cleric/oracle 3, druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M (a handful of ash)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "touch", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "creature touched", "duration": "24 hours", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Fortitude negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "You temporarily drain youth and vitality from the target and channel it into yourself.

You must make a ranged touch attack to strike a target. If you hit, the target can attempt a Reflex save. On a successful save, the target is entangled for the duration of the spell and suffers no other effects. If the target fails this saving throw, the tendril is more restrictive, making the target grappled and dealing it 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage. Each round when you concentrate to maintain the spell, the snare attempts a grapple combat maneuver check to maintain the grapple. As normal when grappling, the snare gains a +5 bonus on grapple combat maneuver checks against opponents it is already grappling. The snare's CMB is equal to 6 + your caster level, and its CMD is equal to 16 + your caster level. Since the ectoplasm passes between planes, this spell affects incorporeal and ethereal creatures normally.  You remain tethered to the target for the duration of the spell. You can shrink or extend the snare, but if the distance between you and the target exceeds the spell's range, the snare disappears. The ectoplasmic tether has hardness 10 and a number of hit points equal to 10 + your caster level + your Constitution modifier, and the tether can be damaged or sundered anywhere along its length. You are not considered to have the grappled condition while tethered to the target. You can perform the move or damage action on a successfully grappled target, moving it up to half your speed or dealing an additional 1d6+4 points of bludgeoning damage to it on a successful grapple combat maneuver check.
