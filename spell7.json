You must be on the Astral or Ethereal Plane or on a plane that has access to one of those planes (such as the Material Plane) to cast this spell.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you decide whether the demiplane is within the Astral or the Ethereal Plane. It is filled with air or water (decided by you). The plane is generally flat and featureless, such as an earth, stone, water, or wood floor. The \"walls\" and \"ceiling\" of the plane may appear like solid earth, stone, wood, or water, or they may end in mist, a featureless void, or a similar unreal-looking border. The plane's environmental conditions are those of a temperate spring day on the Material Plane. You determine the plane's light level (bright, normal, dim, or darkness), which affects the entire plane.</p><p>There are no native creatures or plants on this plane, though you may bring some there (if the plane's light is bright or normal, it counts as sunlight for growing plants). The environment of the plane counts as normal terrain for the purpose of effects that target earth, stone, wood, and so on.</p><p>For example, you could use <i>move earth</i> to create a hill or <i>wall of stone</i> to create a barricade.</p><p>When you finish casting this spell, you may bring yourself and up to seven other creatures to the plane automatically by joining hands in a circle. The demiplane is another plane of existence, and therefore is outside the range of any spell or ability that cannot affect or reach other planes. Creatures can only enter the plane by the use of planar travel magic such as <i>astral projection</i>, <i>etherealness</i>, or <i>plane shift</i>. You are considered \"very familiar\" with your entire demiplane.</p><p>As a standard action, you may eject a creature from your demiplane. The creature may resist with a Will saving throw. An ejected creature goes to the closest plane to your demiplane (usually the Astral Plane or the Ethereal Plane, but if you cast this spell on the Material Plane, the creature is sent to the Material Plane). When the spell ends, the plane dissolves, and all creatures in the plane are ejected in this manner with no saving throw. The plane cannot be dispelled, but a creature on the plane can destroy it by using <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, mage's disjunction, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> and making a successful dispel check.</p><p>If you are within the demiplane, you can add to its area by casting the spell again. Alternatively, you may cast this spell again to reset the duration of an existing area to that of your latest casting. If the duration on one area of the demiplane ends and other parts remain, creatures in the expiring area are shunted to remaining areas. If a collapsing portion of the demiplane would leave one section cut off from other sections of the demiplane (for example, if there were three areas connected in a straight line and the center part expired), the stranded sections count as separate demiplanes under your control. You may reconnect these stranded sections by the spell again to create a linked area between the two.</p><p>You can make this spell permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell, at a cost of 17,500 gp. If you have cast <i>create lesser demiplane</i> multiple times to enlarge the demiplane, each casting's area requires its own <i>permanency</i> spell.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "7", "wiz": "7", "cleric": "7", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": "5", "witch": "7", "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "7", "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "7", "domain": "", "short_description": "Create your own demiplane.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": "Create Demiplane, Lesser", "id": 1022, "material_costs": "500", "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "7", "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": "5", "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": "6"}, {"name": "Epidemic", "school": "necromancy", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "disease, evil", "spell_level": "cleric/oracle 6, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 6", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "living creature", "duration": "instantaneous", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Fortitude negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "The target contracts one of the following diseases: blinding sickness, bubonic plague, cackle fever, filth fever, leprosy, mindfire, red ache, shakes, or slimy doom (Core Rulebook 557), as the spell contagion.

For the duration of the spell, the ship can travel beneath the water as easily as it did above. While under the effects of this spell, the ship has magical propulsion that gives it a maximum speed of 120 feet and an acceleration of 30 feet (see the Skull & Shackles Player's Guide for details). The ship's pilot uses the normal sailing skill to control the ship while under this spell's effects, and can command it to dive and ascend as part of the vessel's normal movement. Despite the magical propulsion, the ship still requires its crew to perform its normal functions.  The spell protects the ship and all aboard from the dangers of drowning and pressure, but not from damage from outside obstacles or creatures. The bubble cannot be used offensively and prevents an affected ship from rising into a space that won't accommodate it (like a sea cave too small to contain it or under another vessel). Creatures can enter or leave the bubble at will, but those outside the sphere cannot be forced inside against their will, the sphere proving substantial enough that such creatures may choose whether to enter or to slip away along its sides. At the end of the spell's duration the bubble pops, causing a ship still underwater at that time to gain the sinking condition. This spell has no effect if cast upon a ship in water that cannot cover the vessel entirely.  Although largely beneficial, this spell can be cast on a ship whose pilot does not want to submerge her vessel. The ship itself uses its Will saving throw to resist this effect.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 1, "sor": "7", "wiz": "7", "cleric": "7", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "7", "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "7", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 1474, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Archon's Trumpet", "school": "evocation", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "good, sonic", "spell_level": "bard 5, cleric/oracle 7, paladin 4, sorcerer/wizard 7", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S", "costly_components": 0, "range": "30 ft.", "area": "cone-shaped burst", "effect": "", "targets": "", "duration": "instantaneous", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Fortitude negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "Upon hearing a booming report, as if from a trumpet archon's mighty horn, all creatures in the area of the burst are paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.", "description_formatted": "<p>Upon hearing a booming report, as if from a trumpet archon's mighty horn, all creatures in the area of the burst are paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.</p>", "source": "Champions Of Purity", "full_text": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"href=\"PF.css\"><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Archon's Trumpet</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>School </b>evocation [good, sonic]; <b>Level </b>bard 5, cleric/oracle 7, paladin 4, sorcerer/wizard 7</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>CASTING</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Casting Time </b>1 standard action</h5><h5><b>Components </b>V, S</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>EFFECT</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>Range </b>30 ft.</h5><h5><b>Area </b>cone-shaped burst</h5><h5><b>Duration </b>instantaneous</h5><h5><b>Saving Throw </b>Fortitude negates; <b>Spell Resistance </b>yes</h5></div><hr/><div><h5><b>DESCRIPTION</b></h5></div><hr/><div><h4><p>Upon hearing a booming report, as if from a trumpet archon's mighty horn, all creatures in the area of the burst are paralyzed for 1d4 rounds.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "7", "wiz": "7", "cleric": "7", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": "5", "paladin": "4", "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "7", "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "7", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 1, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 1, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 1636, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Terraform", "school": "transmutation", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "cleric/oracle 7, druid 6, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7, psychic 7", "casting_time": "1 hour", "components": "V, S, M (10,000 gp worth of precious minerals, see text)", "costly_components": 1, "range": "100 feet", "area": "100-foot-radius emanation, centered on you", "effect": "", "targets": "", "duration": "1 day/level (see text)", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "none", "spell_resistance": "no", "description": "You alter the area's terrain and climate to a new terrain and climate type appropriate to the planet or plane.
