A <i>wall of ice</i> cannot form in an area occupied by physical objects or creatures. Its surface must be smooth and unbroken when created. Any creature adjacent to the wall when it is created may attempt a Reflex save to disrupt the wall as it is being formed. A successful save indicates that the spell automatically fails.</p><p>Fire can melt a <i>wall of ice</i>, and it deals full damage to the wall (instead of the normal half damage taken by objects). Suddenly melting a <i>wall of ice</i> creates a great cloud of steamy fog that lasts for 10 minutes.</p><p><i>Ice Plane</i>: A sheet of strong, hard ice appears. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level. It covers up to a 10-foot-square area per caster level (so a 10th-level wizard can create a <i>wall of ice</i> 100 feet long and 10 feet high, a wall 50 feet long and 20 feet high, or any other combination of length and height that does not exceed 1,000 square feet). The plane can be oriented in any fashion as long as it is anchored. A vertical wall need only be anchored on the floor, while a horizontal or slanting wall must be anchored on two opposite sides.</p><p>Each 10-foot square of wall has 3 hit points per inch of thickness.</p><p>Creatures can hit the wall automatically. A section of wall whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 15 + caster level.</p><p>Even when the ice has been broken through, a sheet of frigid air remains. Any creature stepping through it (including the one who broke through the wall) takes 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level (no save).</p><p><i>Hemisphere</i>: The wall takes the form of a <i>hemisphere</i> whose maximum radius is 3 feet + 1 foot per caster level. The <i>hemisphere</i> is as hard to break through as the <i>ice plane</i> form, but it does not deal damage to those who go through a breach.</p></h4><h5><b>Mythic: </b>The wall's hit points increase to 5 hit points per inch of thickness. Add your tier to the Strength check DC to break through the wall. The damage dealt to those that step through the wall increases to 1d8 points of cold damage + 1 point per caster level. Any creature that passes through the wall must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered for 1d4 rounds; this is a cold effect.</h5><h5><b>Augmented (5th)</b>: If you expend two uses of mythic power, you cover the wall in sharp, protruding icicles. Any creature that touches, strikes, or breaks through the wall takes 1d6 points of cold damage, 1d6 points of piercing damage, and 1 point of bleed damage.</h5></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": "3", "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": "4", "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": "Ice plane creates wall or hemisphere creates dome.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 1, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": "Wall of Ice", "id": 599, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "Boreal (9), Marid (9)", "patron": "Elements (8), Winter (8)", "mythic_text": "The wall's hit points increase to 5 hit points per inch of thickness.

If you're successful, the trap ward dispels the magical effect of the trap before the effect actually manifests, effectively preventing the trap from triggering for the next 1d4 rounds and ending Aram Zey's trap ward immediately.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 1236, "material_costs": "100", "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Bite the Hand", "school": "enchantment", "subschool": "compulsion", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "druid 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, witch 4", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, DF", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one creature summoned by a spell or spell-like ability", "duration": "1 round/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "With a short command and a wave of the hand, you compel the target creature to attack the being who summoned it, to the best of its ability.

The entity gains certain powers according to caster level, just like a mount does in the <i>phantom steed</i> spell.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": "3", "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": "Conjures a quasi-real heavy chariot pulled by four horses.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": "Phantom Chariot", "id": 1382, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": "4", "spiritualist": "4", "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": "3"}, {"name": "Phantom Steed, Communal", "school": "conjuration", "subschool": "creation", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner/unchained summoner 3, occultist 4, spiritualist 4", "casting_time": "10 minutes", "components": "V, S", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "", "effect": "up to six quasi-real, horselike creatures", "targets": "", "duration": "1 hour/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "none", "spell_resistance": "no", "description": "This spell functions like phantom steed, except you can summon up to six steeds, and you divide the duration in 1-hour intervals among the steeds summoned.", "description_formatted": "<p>This spell functions like <i>phantom steed</i>, except you can summon up to six steeds, and you divide the duration in 1-hour intervals among the steeds summoned.</p>", "source": "Ultimate Combat", "full_text": "<link rel=\"stylesheet\"href=\"PF.css\"><div class=\"heading\"><p class=\"alignleft\">Phantom Steed, Communal</p><div style=\"clear: both;\"></div></div><div><h5><b>School </b>conjuration (creation);

If you successfully cast <i>mindscape door</i> within a veiled mindscape, you learn that you are in a mindscape, but other creatures observing the door don't automatically realize they are.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": "Create a portal allowing entry to and exit from a mindscape.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 1, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2218, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "Mind (6)", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "3", "medium": "3", "mesmerist": "3", "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Mindwipe", "school": "enchantment", "subschool": "compulsion", "descriptor": "mind-affecting", "spell_level": "medium 4, mesmerist 4, occultist 4, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one creature", "duration": "instantaneous; see text", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "You erase a portion of the target's mind and experiences, inflicting 2 temporary negative levels on the target for 1 day per caster level.

Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2306, "material_costs": "1000", "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": "3", "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Wall Of Brine", "school": "conjuration", "subschool": "creation", "descriptor": "water", "spell_level": "druid 4, magus 4, ranger 3, shaman 4, sorcerer/wizard 4", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M/DF (a bit of coral)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)", "area": "", "effect": "wall up to 10 ft./level long and 5 ft./level high (S)", "targets": "", "duration": "concentration + 1 round/level", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "none; see text", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "You conjure a 5-foot-thick wall of seawater with a powerful current flowing toward one side of the wall, selected by you; a creature attempting to swim against this current must spend 4 squares of movement to enter a square of the wall.

It cannot be used to bridge a chasm, for instance, or to act as a ramp. Each 5-foot square of the wall has hardness 4 and 7 hit points per inch of thickness. A section of wall whose hit points drops to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the wall with a single attack, the DC of the Strength check is equal to 15 + 2 per inch of thickness.  For each creature adjacent to the wall, the skeletal hands attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple it. The skeletal hands do not provoke attacks of opportunity. They make their attacks at the start of your turn, when the wall is summoned, or when an enemy first moves adjacent to the wall. The skeletal hands' CMB is equal to your caster level, and they can grapple a Huge or smaller creature with no penalty.  If the wall successfully grapples a foe, that foe takes 1d6 points of damage and gains the grappled condition. Grappled opponents cannot move without first breaking the grapple. All other movement is prohibited unless the creature breaks the grapple first. The wall cannot move or pin foes. Each round the wall succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver check, it deals 1d6 additional points of damage. The CMD of the wall, for the purposes of escaping the grapple, is equal to 10 + its CMB.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": "4", "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": null, "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "4", "antipaladin": "4", "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 0, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2545, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": "4", "shaman": null, "psychic": "4", "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": "4", "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Akashic Communion", "school": "divination", "subschool": "", "descriptor": "", "spell_level": "bard 3, medium 3, mesmerist 4, occultist 3, psychic 3, shaman 3, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, witch 3", "casting_time": "10 minutes", "components": "V, S, M/DF (a square of reflective silver worth 100 gp)", "costly_components": 1, "range": "personal", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "", "duration": "1 minute/level", "dismissible": 0, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "", "spell_resistance": "", "description": "You attempt to obtain a glimpse of some specific event from the Akashic Record (Occult Adventures 244), the extraplanar repository of all experiences that have ever occurred.

Creatures fascinated by mad sultan's melody become immune to any other casting of the spell for 24 hours after the spell ends, and the spell ends if the fascination breaks on any of its targets for any reason (such as an attack).  If you have the bardic performance class feature and the fascinate bardic performance, you can choose to use the spell's saving throw DC or a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 your levels in the class that grants you bardic performance + your Charisma modifier, whichever is higher. If you choose to use the latter DC, each round of the melody costs 1 round of bardic performance and it counts as an active performance for determining how many performances you can have active.  This spell takes a toll on the caster. Each time you cast it, you take 1d4 points of Wisdom damage. If your campaign uses the sanity system (see page 12), you instead take 2d6 points of sanity damage.</p></h4></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 0, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 0, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": null, "druid": null, "ranger": null, "bard": "3", "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": "4", "inquisitor": null, "oracle": null, "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": " Bizarre cacophony fascinates eldritch creatures.", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 0, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 0, "evil": 0, "fear": 0, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 1, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 1, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2667, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": null, "psychic": "4", "medium": null, "mesmerist": "4", "occultist": "4", "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": null, "haunt_statistics": "", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Phantasmal Asphyxiation", "school": "illusion", "subschool": "phantasm", "descriptor": "mind-affecting", "spell_level": "medium 3, mesmerist 4, psychic 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, witch 4", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M (an empty vial)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)", "area": "", "effect": "", "targets": "one living creature", "duration": "1 round/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 0, "saving_throw": "Will disbelief, then Fortitude partial (see text)", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "Your target must succeed at a Will save or believe it can no longer breathe.

Each time the haunt attempts a dispel check, the spell's haunt-like manifestation occurs during that round.</p></h4></div><div><h5><b>Haunt Statistics</b></h5></div><div><h5><b>Notice</b> Perception DC 25 (to feel a biting chill as if through the touch of a frozen hand)  <br><b>hp </b>2 hp/level; <b>Trigger</b> proximity; <b>Reset</b> none</h5></div>", "verbal": 1, "somatic": 1, "material": 1, "focus": 0, "divine_focus": 1, "sor": "4", "wiz": "4", "cleric": "4", "druid": "4", "ranger": "3", "bard": null, "paladin": null, "alchemist": null, "summoner": null, "witch": "4", "inquisitor": null, "oracle": "4", "antipaladin": null, "magus": null, "adept": null, "deity": "", "SLA_Level": "4", "domain": "", "short_description": "", "acid": 0, "air": 0, "chaotic": 0, "cold": 1, "curse": 0, "darkness": 0, "death": 0, "disease": 0, "earth": 0, "electricity": 0, "emotion": 1, "evil": 0, "fear": 1, "fire": 0, "force": 0, "good": 0, "language_dependent": 0, "lawful": 0, "light": 0, "mind_affecting": 1, "pain": 0, "poison": 0, "shadow": 0, "sonic": 0, "water": 0, "linktext": null, "id": 2698, "material_costs": null, "bloodline": "", "patron": "", "mythic_text": "", "augmented": "", "mythic": 0, "bloodrager": null, "shaman": "4", "psychic": null, "medium": null, "mesmerist": null, "occultist": null, "spiritualist": null, "skald": null, "investigator": null, "hunter": "3", "haunt_statistics": "Notice Perception DC 25 (to feel a biting chill as if through the touch of a frozen hand)  hp 2 hp/level; Trigger proximity; Reset none", "ruse": 0, "draconic": 0, "meditative": 0, "summoner_unchained": null}, {"name": "Mischievous Shadow", "school": "necromancy", "subschool": "haunted", "descriptor": "emotionUM, fear, mind-affecting", "spell_level": "bard 4, magus 4, medium 3, shaman 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, spiritualist 4, summoner/unchained summoner 4, witch 4", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "components": "V, S, M (a black candle)", "costly_components": 0, "range": "close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)", "area": "one 5-ft. cube/level (S)", "effect": "", "targets": "", "duration": "1 day/level (D)", "dismissible": 1, "shapeable": 1, "saving_throw": "Will negates", "spell_resistance": "yes", "description": "You direct spirits into the shadows of creatures.

A sacrifice can be used in a variety of ways.  Bargain: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being grants you a bonus on opposed Charisma checks made to compel the creature into service for the next hour.  Enticement: Making a sacrifice the round before conjuring increases the DC of the Will save an outsider must attempt to resist being conjured.  Payment: Making a sacrifice directly to the conjured being allows you to pay for one service from the creature in commodities other than gold.  Reinforcement: Making a sacrifice the round before creating a magic circle and preparing a summoning diagram amplifies the power of its warding magic, increasing the DC of Charisma checks the creature might attempt to escape. This lasts 1 day.  Multiple sacrifices can be made to affect a single conjuring, but the bonuses provided by this spell do not stack. Therefore, while you can make sacrifices to aid in conjuring and bargaining with a creature, you cannot make multiple sacrifices (even of varying types) to enhance the same effect for a particular conjuration.  A sacrifice can consist of any kind of commodity the target creature favors, including living creatures, treasures, or more ephemeral offerings. While this spell is not fundamentally evil, good-aligned creatures are more selective in what offerings they accept, typically scoffing at blood sacrifices. Many sacrifices are fundamentally evil acts, such as murdering a pious innocent to conjure a fiend. Any creature might reject certain types of sacrifices, thus denying you the benefits of this spell, as the offering must appeal to the target-few outsiders would care for 2,000 gp worth of parchment, while 2,000 gp of diamonds would be widely coveted. The GM determines what sacrifices creatures find appealing.  The table below lists a number of likely offerings, along with the bonus such gifts provide and the offering's equivalent value in gold pieces for the purposes of planar ally. Several of these sacrifices involve the loss of ability scores, levels, or lives, and some can cause changes in alignment. Any change wrought by such sacrifices (loss of ability score or level, or change in alignment) cannot be recovered, cured, or undone by any spell or effect short of miracle or wish. The same is true of creatures killed as a sacrifice; such creatures cannot be resurrected by any magic less powerful than these spells. Any object sacrificed with this spell is effectively destroyed or removed to an extraplanar holding of the conjured creature's choice. The bonuses and values noted on the sacrifice effects table are guidelines for offerings; certain types of treasures or lives might prove especially valuable to specific creatures, with extraordinary sacrifices (such as a potent artifact or the life of a high-level paladin) garnering increased bonuses.  You cannot make greater sacrifices than those noted on the table to gain increased bonuses or gold values.

This area is stationary and becomes dark and gloomy, reducing the light level by one step (as darkness). Certain spells are enhanced within the area; spells of the shadow subschool that have reduced effects when disbelieved (such as shadow evocation) have their reduced effects increased by 20% (to a maximum of 90%) when determining their effects on targets within the area of shadow invasion.  In addition, the rift created by shadow invasion has a chance of attracting attention from the other side, and the spell can be inverted to bring these watchers through.
